zimdown
=======

### zimdown is a ZIM to markdown conversion tool.
Originally, I created zimdown to turn my existing notes into notes that could
be easily read by the github markdown interpreter. I was looking for a way
to markdown my notes so that they could be written in vim with no problems 
whatsoever. Here is the result.

So far the process looks a little something like this
* zimdown.sh copies all directories/files to specified location
* zimdown.c  converts the contents of all files to markdown from zim
